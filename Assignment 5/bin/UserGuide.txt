User Guide On How To Play ZType:

Extra Credit: 
-  Added a feature that keeps score during the game and returns the final score in
   final scene (score increases each time a correct letter is typed).
-  Improved animation to be more fluid (improved frame rate for game)
-  Enhanced background graphics in the game background and in the ending scene


Our ZType game is played by simply typing the letters of randomly generated words
that appear on the screen. There will be multiple words on the screen throughout the 
game, however you can only type the letters of one of the words at a time.
As you type the corresponding letters for the word, they will be removed from the 
word and when the full word is typed out, it will be fully removed from the screen.
If there are two or more words on the screen that start with the same letter, the program
will begin removing letters from the word that is closest to the bottom of the screen.
If a word is not typed out fully before it hits the bottom of the screen then the game
will end with a game over screen.

Disclaimer: the images for the game are stored within the zip file, however in the events
that the images do not load properly, the game will continue to run just without 
the presence of the images.
